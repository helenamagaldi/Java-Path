JVM  understands certain commands, that are also called opcodes (operation code), and each opcode is exactly 1 Byte. So, we have a 1 Byte Opcode, or Bytecode. 
The JVM is the one responsible for executing the bytecode, BUT both JVM and JRE execute bytecode.
JRE contains JVM, but also has a lot of embebbed libraries - if we want the java application is to work, it needs libraries on top of the virtual machine. 

JDK = JRE + development tools

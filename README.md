JVM  understands certain commands. These commands are also called opcodes (operation code) e each opcode is exactly 1 Byte. So, we have a 1 Byte Opcode, or Bytecode. 
So, it's the JVM that has the responsibility to execute bytecode.
But both JVM and JRE execute bytecode.
JRE contains JVM, but also has a lot of embebbed libraries - if we want the java application to work, you need libraries on top of the virtual machine. 

JDK = JRE + development tools
